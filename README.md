# CurrentWeather
This script will retrieve the current weather data for the city specified in the query variable and print out a summary of the current conditions, including the temperature, weather condition, humidity, and wind speed. You can customize the units of temperature by modifying the units variable (either 'imperial' for Fahrenheit or 'metric' for Celsius).

Before using this script, you will need to sign up for a free API key from AccuWeather and replace YOUR_API_KEY in the script with your actual API key. You can find more information and documentation for the AccuWeather API at the following link:
